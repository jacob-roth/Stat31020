# Stat31020
- author: jake roth
- description: helpers to interface with ReverseSparseDiff
- usage: use the Stat30120.jl module in /src as the function wrapper; need to edit (1) objective function `f`; (2) objective function `NLobjective`; (3) `NLconstraint`s (which can be blank for unconstrained optimization)
